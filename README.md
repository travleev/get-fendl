# Set of scripts to download FENDL-2.1 and FENDL-3.0 libraies and prepare for use with MCNP


The scripts automatize downloading, unzipping and preparing of FENDL libraries
for use with MCNP.  These scripts rely on `wget`, `unzip`, `csplit`, `awk` and
`sed`  standard linux utilities and also uses `makxsf` programm that is part of
MCNP distribution. The latter is used to put all cross-sections into a single
file.
